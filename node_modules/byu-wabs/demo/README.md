# Demo Guide

The demo will only run if your system is property set up.

The WABS middleware can only function if the required configuration options for the application are specified, including:

- WSO2 Consumer Key
- WSO2 Consumer Secret
- Encrypt Secret

These three properties are confidential and, although the demo application has very little authorization, these properties have been protected by using AWS Parameter Store.
